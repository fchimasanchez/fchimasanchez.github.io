# Section 1.2 The Real Number System

**Purpose:** establish the algebraic structure, metric structure, and ordering of the real number system.

**Learning objectives:**
1. Define and apply the field axioms of the real number system $\mathbf{R}$ equipped with binary addition and multiplication, and scalar multiplication.
2. Define and apply the metric properties of absolute value on the real number line.
3. Define and apply the total ordering < on the real number line.
4. Apply order of operations to simplify expressions with a real variable.
