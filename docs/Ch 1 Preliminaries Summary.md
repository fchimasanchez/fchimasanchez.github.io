C. Express sets in the rectangular coordinate plane using equations.

D. Distinguish between relations and functions of real numbers.

E. Identify key characteristics of functions and represent their graphs on the coordinate plane.

F. Apply transformations on functions and their graphs.

G. Operate on functions of real numbers.

H. Convert between degree and radian angle measure.

I. Solve right triangles using trigonometry.

J. Apply trigonometric identities in a variety of contexts.

K. Connect properties of trigonometric functions to representations of the unit circle.

L. Solve a variety of equations and inequalities.

M. Apply the Binomial Theorem in a variety of contexts.
