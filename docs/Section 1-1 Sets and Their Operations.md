# Section 1.1 Sets and Their Operations

**Purpose:** establish the basic objects and notation of mathematics using sets and operations on sets.

**Learning objectives:** 
1. Define and apply set, element, cardinality, subset, universe of discourse, union, intersection, and complement.
2. Determine whether a number is an element of a stated set.
3. Distinguish between natural numbers $\mathbf{N}$, whole numbers, integers $\mathbf{Z}$, rational numbers $\mathbf{Q}$, and irrational numbers.
4. Express a set in set notation.
5. Express a set in interval notation.
6. Express a set on the real number line.
7. Determine the union $\cup$ of two or more sets.
8. Determine the intersection $\cap$ of two or more sets.
9. Determine the complement $\circ^c$ of a set with respect to the universe of discourse.
10. Find the cardinality of a finite set.
